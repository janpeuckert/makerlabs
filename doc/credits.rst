=============================================

*makerlabs* is based on several years of experimentation, which lead to the development of the module only in 2016.

The research leading to these results started in 2014 while Massimo Menichinelli was studying at `Aalto University`_. This first development was later elaborated into a full software library and full analysis while working at IAAC_ | `Fab City Research Lab`_ in 2016-17 within the Horizon 2020 project MAKE-IT_. Part of work on this software has received funding from the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Union within the MAKE-IT_ project under grant agreement n° 688241. This publication reflects only the author’s view and the Union is not liable for any use that may be made of the information contained therein.

Massimo Menichinelli, project manager at IAAC_ | `Fab City Research Lab`_ and doctoral candidate at `Media Lab Helsinki`_ (`Aalto University`), has investigated, lectured and work on the connections between Design and Open Source, Fab Lab and Maker movements since 2005.
